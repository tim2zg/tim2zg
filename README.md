# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to contact me on any platform! I know about the struggle to find other nerds. If you want to contribute to any of my projects, feel free ðŸ˜Š. (Yes I know that I should write better commends and docs, I hope that I can improve it in future ðŸ¤”). You also can invite me to your projects if you want. But keep in mind that I donâ€™t have a lot of time ðŸ˜’.

This means that Iâ€™ve worked with it. Or still working. Sometimes I'm better than this.
